# Water Density Scale App 

1.When the page loads the “water-level” urlparams should indicate the initial state of the water level ( If no water level is set assume 0.)

2.The add button should increase the water-level by 100ml each time

3.The remove button should be deactivated if the water-level is 0 ml

4.Once the water level reaches 1000 ml the add button should be deactivated.

5.The change in state should be reflected in the urlparams
